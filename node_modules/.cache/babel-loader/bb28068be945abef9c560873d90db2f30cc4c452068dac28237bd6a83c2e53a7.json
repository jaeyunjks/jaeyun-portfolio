When I think about how much work I have to do and how long I have to be sitting down for, I get worried and a little stressed about how much work there is and if I'll be ok sitting down for so long. Even though I can make it through most days just fine, it's really exhausting and draining though afterwards. It's really difficult to manage my time when I feel so much pressure on myself to get everything done as soon as I can so that I don't have to worry about it later but it just never ends. I don't know what I can do other than keep working until it's gone. I've even been having trouble making time for food breaks, let alone exercise, and it just gets worse when I waste my time on youtube or instagram instead of working. It's just a spiral that never feels like it's getting better. Doing the work sometimes cheers me up because I love doing digital art even when it's for work, and I enjoy watching videos too but I feel like I'll eventually burn out on everything because I just want to do it so much too. My posture has also been getting really bad recently since I have to sit still so much focused on a screen, I can barely get up off the chair sometimes after I finish. I feel like I've tried everything to keep myself on a schedule but nothing seems to work, and I live alone so I don't have anyone to help me with it either.`\n}, {\n  title: \"Future Use Scenario\",\n  desc: \"Design solution improves wellbeing and productivity.\",\n  content: `I start everyday at the same time, not too early in the morning because I can work from home, so usually I start at 9am. Sometimes, I even stay in bed a little after my phone gives me a notification to wake up for the day and eat breakfast, but usually I start then. Afterwards, I walk over to my desk and open up the laptop, while also checking my day's schedule on my phone. Feeling confident with the workload I've got set for the day, I go through my to do list as they alert me on my phone. I've since corrected my bad work habits thanks to the desk's sensors telling me when I'm acting too anxious working. After a couple hours, my phone gives me forewarning before the desk lowers itself for the scheduled break for the day, and usually I decide to either exercise and make a small snack, or drag a chair over to have a quick break on social media or draw a little. I've been feeling really healthy and on top of things ever since I've been able to follow the schedules I've set, and the table enforcing the schedule alongside phone notifications really feels like someone tapping on my shoulder and helping me along my day. It's really reassuring. Since I started to following the schedule I set for myself, I feel like my workload has become so much lighter and manageable even though nothing has changed. Sometimes I even feel like I can squeeze some meetups with friends in-between my schedule.`\n}, {\n  title: \"Storyboard\",\n  desc: \"User flow visual showing solution in context.\",\n  file:

for a bit while I take in what I need to do for the day. When I think about how much work I have to do and how long I have to be sitting down for, I get worried and a little stressed about how much work there is and if I'll be ok sitting down for so long. Even though I can make it through most days just fine, it's really exhausting and draining though afterwards. It's really difficult to manage my time when I feel so much pressure on myself to get everything done as soon as I can so that I don't have to worry about it later but it just never ends. I don't know what I can do other than keep working until it's gone. I've even been having trouble making time for food breaks, let alone exercise, and it just gets worse when I waste my time on youtube or instagram instead of working. It's just a spiral that never feels like it's getting better. Doing the work sometimes cheers me up because I love doing digital art even when it's for work, and I enjoy watching videos too but I feel like I'll eventually burn out on everything because I just want to do it so much too. My posture has also been getting really bad recently since I have to sit still so much focused on a screen, I can barely get up off the chair sometimes after I finish. I feel like I've tried everything to keep myself on a schedule but nothing seems to work, and I live alone so I don't have anyone to help me with it either.`\n    },\n    {\n        title: \"Future Use Scenario\",\n        desc: \"Design solution improves wellbeing and productivity.\",\n        content: `I start everyday at the same time, not too early in the morning because I can work from home, so usually I start at 9am. Sometimes, I even stay in bed a little after my phone gives me a notification to wake up for the day and eat breakfast, but usually I start then. Afterwards, I walk over to my desk and open up the laptop, while also checking my day's schedule on my phone. Feeling confident with the workload I've got set for the day, I go through my to do list as they alert me on my phone. I've since corrected my bad work habits thanks to the desk's sensors telling me when I'm acting too anxious working. After a couple hours, my phone gives me forewarning before the desk lowers itself for the scheduled break for the day, and usually I decide to either exercise and make a small snack, or drag a chair over to have a quick break on social media or draw a little. I've been feeling really healthy and on top of things ever since I've been able to follow the schedules I've set, and the table enforcing the schedule alongside phone notifications really feels like someone tapping on my shoulder and helping me along my day. It's really reassuring. Since I started to following the schedule I set for myself, I feel like my workload has become so much lighter and manageable even though nothing has changed. Sometimes I even feel like I can squeeze some meetups with friends in-between my schedule.`\n    },\n    {\n        title: \"Storyboard\",\n        desc: \"User flow visual showing solution in
